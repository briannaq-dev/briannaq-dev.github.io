        Monte Carlo is a data visualization project focused on modeling and simulating uncertainty in investment portfolios. 
        The tool helped users intuitively grasp the probability distributions of expected returns—bridging the gap between
        abstract statistical models and practical financial insights. My role combined leadership and technical oversight, 
        ensuring the simulation logic, visualization design, and project documentation were aligned across the team.

      <ul>
        <li>Spearheaded weekly meetings, established team deliverables, and maintained communication between liaisons and internal team.</li>
        <li>Built a Monte Carlo simulation model to forecast price paths and visualize confidence intervals using GBM and Matplotlib.</li>
        <li>Automated real-time stock data retrieval and preprocessing from public markets using Yahoo Finance API and Pandas.</li>
        <li>Implemented a pipeline to generate volatility trends, moving averages, and correlation matrices using NumPy and Pandas</li>

        SpotiRecs is a full-stack web application that analyzes a user's inputed song(s) and recommends new songs that match 
        the "vibe" using a machine learning model. The project features a user-friendly interface for song input and builds
        custom albums based on user-selected songs. It uses K-Means clustering on audio features to find and rank songs that
        are sonically and stylistically similar.
      </p>
      <h4>Key Contributions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Built full-stack song recommendation app with mock login and dashboard routing using React and Flask.</li>
        <li>Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning model to match songs by features using Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn</li>
      </ul>
