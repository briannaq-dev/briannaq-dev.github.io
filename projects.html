        Foresight is an AI-driven hotel revenue intelligence startup that leverages event data and market analytics 
        to help hotels optimize pricing and occupancy in real time. As the Consulting PM, I led a five-member team in 
        researching market dynamics, competitive positioning, and channel partnerships to inform the startup’s go-to-market 
        strategy. As a TC Developer, I collaborated with the development team to prototype a data pipeline for event-based 
        demand forecasting, integrating APIs from hospitality and event data sources. My work focused on translating business 
        goals into data-backed insights, strengthening the product’s strategic positioning within the hospitality technology 
        landscape.
