      Hi, I’m Brianna Quinn, a junior at Northeastern University studying Data Science and Business Administration with a concentration in FinTech.
      I'm currently based in Boston, MA and the Greater Philadelphia Area. Beyond academics, I’m an active musician and martial artist, which
      shapes my approach to leadership, creativity, and problem-solving.
